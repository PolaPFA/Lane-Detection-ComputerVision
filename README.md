# Lane-Detection-ComputerVision
<br>
Lane detection for autonomus cars.
This porject was part of Commputer Vision course syllabus. The project worked with traditional image processing methods to detect the lanes of the streets.

### Tools used:
#### Python scripting language with the following libraries:
<ul>
 <li> <strong> Matplotlib: </strong> For presenting the frames of the video. </li>
 <li> <strong> OpenCV: </strong> for drawing the lines on the video frames </li>
 <li> <strong> NumPy: </strong> for the basic mathematical calculations </li>
 </ul>
 
 ### What to find in this repo:
 <ol>
 <li> The code for the lane detection project </li>
 <li> Code for some helper functions that is needed by the project to run (Gaussian Filter, Selecting White Ranges....) </li>
 <li> Code for Hough Transform which the project is based on </li>
 </ol>
